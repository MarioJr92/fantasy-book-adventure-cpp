# A Text-based Adventure Game in C++

This is a simple text-based adventure game in C++, where you, the player, find yourself in a magical forest and must make choices to determine your fate.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply compile and run the code using a C++ compiler. The program will start by asking you to choose between two paths, and the story will unfold based on the choices you make.

## How to Play

- Choose a path by entering "1" or "2" when prompted.
- Follow the story and make choices by entering the corresponding number when prompted.
- If your input is invalid, the program will prompt you to try again.
- Enjoy the story and see where your choices lead you!

## Game Flow

- You start in a magical forest and must choose between two paths.
- If you choose path 1, you will encounter a talking rabbit who offers to guide you through the forest. You must choose whether to accept the rabbit's help or try to find your own way.
  - If you accept the rabbit's help, you will be led to a treasure chest and must make a wish for your future.
  - If you try to find your own way, you will get lost in the forest and never be seen again.
- If you choose path 2, you will encounter a group of bandits who demand your belongings. You must choose whether to give them your things or fight them.
  - If you give them your things, you will wander the forest alone and eventually die of starvation.
  - If you fight the bandits and win, you will find a map that leads to treasure and must choose whether to follow it or leave the forest.
